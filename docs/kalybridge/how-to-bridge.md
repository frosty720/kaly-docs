# How to Bridge

This guide walks you through bridging tokens between BSC and KalyChain.

## Prerequisites

- A Web3 wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- Tokens on the source network (BSC or KalyChain)
- Small amount of native tokens for gas (BNB on BSC, KLC on KalyChain)

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Go to the Bridge**: Navigate to [bridge.kalychain.io](https://bridge.kalychain.io/) or [app.kalyswap.io/bridge](https://app.kalyswap.io/bridge).
   
2. **Connect Wallet**: Click the **"Connect Wallet"** button and approve the connection in MetaMask.

3. **Check Network**: 
   - Ensure you are connected to the network you are sending **FROM**.
   - *Example*: If sending from BSC, make sure your wallet is on BSC.

4. **Select Direction**: In the UI, confirm the direction (e.g., BSC → KalyChain).

5. **Select Token**: Use the dropdown to choose the asset you wish to bridge.

6. **Enter Amount**: Input the number of tokens to transfer.

7. **Recipient**:
   - By default, this is your connected wallet address.
   - If sending to a different address, verify it carefully.

8. **Send**:
   - Click **Continue** to review details.
   - Click **SEND** to initiate the transaction.

9. **Confirm**: Sign the transaction in your wallet.

10. **Verify**: Check your recipient address on the explorer to confirm arrival.

:::tip Troubleshooting
If you don't see your tokens immediately, check the transaction status on the block explorer. Cross-chain transactions may take a few minutes to finalize.
