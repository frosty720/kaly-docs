# Earn: Farming & Staking

Maximize your returns on KalySwap by participating in our Yield Farming and Staking programs.

## Yield Farming

Farming allows you to stake your **LP Tokens** (received from providing liquidity) to earn additional rewards, typically in **KLC** or partner project tokens.

### How to Farm
1.  **Get LP Tokens**: Provide liquidity to a supported pair (see [Liquidity Pools](./liquidity)).
2.  Go to the **[Farm Page](https://app.kalyswap.io/farm)**.
3.  Find the Farm that matches your LP tokens (e.g., KLC-USDT LP).
4.  Click **"Enable"** to approve the contract.
5.  Click **"Stake LP"** and enter the amount.
6.  Confirm the transaction.

You will immediately start earning rewards, which you can **Harvest** at any time.

## Staking

Staking is simpler than farming as it typically involves a single asset.

### Features
*   **Single Asset**: Stake KLC or other tokens directly.
*   **No Impermanent Loss**: Since you are not pairing assets, there is no risk of IL.
*   **Compounding**: Some pools allow you to auto-compound your earnings.

For KLC network validation staking, please visit **[staking.kalychain.io](https://staking.kalychain.io)**.
